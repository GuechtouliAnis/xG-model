########## What has been done ##########
- split location into x and y
- calculate distance to goal
- calculate angle of shot
- calculate footedness
- was the shot taken by the player's dominant foot
- extract goal or not from shot outcome
- export shot_freeze_frame as a df
- if player is two footed and shot was not by head or others then shot_preferred_foot must be True
- select features
- export shot_data ready (preprocessed)




########## What needs to be done ##########
IN CODE
- select pass features
- export pass_data ready (preprocessed)
- number of players inside the area of shot (Between the shot and the goal)
- optimize that, distance, angle and number of players inside the area of shot are calculated in the same function
- goalkeeper position
- dummies
- multiplier based on player position (defender, midfielder, attacker)
- try different models
- visualisation functions
- time tracking
- Regularization
- Cross validation
