    - Shot Freeze Frames are not saved when shot is a penalty

[19-12-2024]
    - Finally fixed the issue with the shot freeze frames
    - The issue was in pyspark reading the data, it was not reading the data correctly
    - Used ; as a separator to fix that
    - A direct shot from corner has an xg of 1.8E-4
    - A penalty has an xg of 0.7835
